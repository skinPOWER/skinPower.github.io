            <h3>What is Eczema?</h3>
            <p>Eczema is an inflammatory skin condition that causes skin to become itchy, bumpy, and dry. It is a type of dermatitisâ€“ a group of 7 skin conditions that cause inflammation. It is estimated that over 31 million (10.1%) of people in the US have this condition, and the prevalence peaks during childhood. Living with eczema can be very challenging as individuals often face self-image issues, depression, anxiety, and other comorbidities such as asthma or food allergies.</p>

            <h4>Statistics:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>60.5% of adults with moderate to severe eczema have reported severe or unbearable itch in the past two weeks.</li>
                <li>86% reported daily itch, and 63% reported itching at least 12 hours per day.</li>
                <li>One in four adults with eczema rate their health as "fair" or "poor," with more than 16% being "very" or "somewhat" dissatisfied with life. Negative ratings increase with disease severity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Eczema is much more than "just" an itch or a rash. Severe eczema can take over the entire body, leading to full-body eczema. Even milder cases can affect movement and sleep.</p>

            <h4>Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW):</h4>
            <p>Furthermore, overuse or misuse of topical steroids to treat eczema can lead to a debilitating disorder known as Topical Steroid Withdrawal (TSW). Symptoms of TSW can include burning sensations, flaking of skin, swelling, redness, hair loss, fatigue, and possible depression/disability. This condition can persist for months or years, forcing individuals to stop their regular commitments and focus on recovery.</p>
