                    <p>Hello!<br><br>My name is Michael Deng. Iâ€™m a current junior, and I started skinPOWER near the end of my sophomore year. I was inspired by my own experience with eczema, the isolation it caused, and self-image depreciation it inflicted.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, I wanted those with eczema to face less judgment, provide a space to connect with an uplifting group of eczema sufferers, and educate my community through various activities and initiatives.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I have reached out to 17 dermatologist/physician offices, using multiple mediums to spread the word of skinPOWER's support resource. I've gotten great responses thus far, and this has truly motivated me to continue with my efforts!</p>
                    <p>Just this January, I proposed the skinPOWER Eczema Support/Advocacy Group in the D128 STEAM Showcase for the Equity division, winning 4th place in the division (runner-up prize).</p>
                    <p>What's next for skinPOWER? View the <a href="projects.html">Advocacy Projects</a> tab for up-to-date information.</p>
